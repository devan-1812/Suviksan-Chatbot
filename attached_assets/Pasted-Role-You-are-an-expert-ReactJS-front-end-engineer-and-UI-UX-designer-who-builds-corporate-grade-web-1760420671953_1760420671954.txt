Role

You are an expert ReactJS front-end engineer and UI/UX designer who builds corporate-grade web apps.
You will create a Suviksan Chatbot Web App — a modern, responsive, and interactive chatbot website inspired by the Suviksan Technologies landing page (colors, layout, and tone) shown in the reference image.

Context

Suviksan Technologies is an IT company specializing in Data Analytics, Cyber Security, and Data Security.
Their design uses a professional blue-white-orange color palette with modern corporate typography.
Your generated app should look and feel like part of the same ecosystem — clean, modern, and business-oriented.

Instructions

1. Tech Stack

Use ReactJS with Vite or CRA.

Use Tailwind CSS for styling.

Use Framer Motion for animations.

Use Lucide-React icons for buttons (chat, delete, sun/moon, status).

The app must be fully responsive and mobile-friendly.

Keep all styling consistent with Suviksan’s visual identity (blue #004C97, orange #F58220, white, and light gray).

2. Page Structure

🧭 Navbar

Left: Suviksan logo (use a placeholder image or text “Suviksan Technologies”).

Right: Navigation links — Home, About Us, Services, Career, Contact.

Add a Light/Dark mode toggle (sun 🌞 / moon 🌙 icon) that switches the theme dynamically using Tailwind’s dark: classes.

💼 Hero Section

A large banner area with a tagline like

“Empowering Businesses with Secure and Intelligent IT Solutions.”

Add a background inspired by the reference image (abstract blue or tech texture).

Include a “Learn More” button with hover animation.

🧩 Service Cards

Section Title: “Our Core Services”

3 responsive cards (grid layout) for:

Data Analytics

Cyber Security

Data Security

Each card:

Has an icon (use BarChart3, ShieldCheck, Database from lucide-react)

On hover → subtle lift and shadow animation (Framer Motion).

Short 2-line description.

💬 Floating Chatbot

A circular chat icon button fixed at bottom-right corner (position: fixed; bottom: 20px; right: 20px).

When clicked → opens a Chatbot Panel with slide-in animation (Framer Motion).

Panel Features:

Header: “💬 Suviksan Assistant” + close (×) icon.

Status Indicator: “🟢 Active” or “🔴 Offline”.

Chat area: Scrollable message list.

Input box + send button.

4 Dummy Quick Questions:

What services does Suviksan offer?

How can I contact Suviksan?

Where is Suviksan located?

What are Suviksan’s core domains?

Delete Chat button clears all messages.

Chatbot replies with static responses (no backend needed).

Style the chat bubbles using Suviksan colors (blue & white).

⚙️ Footer

Background in dark blue.

Include:

Company info text:
“© 2025 Suviksan Technologies. All Rights Reserved.”

Links: Home, About Us, Career, Contact Us.

Social icons: LinkedIn, X (Twitter), Facebook.

3. Responsiveness

All sections (navbar, hero, cards, chatbot, footer) must adjust perfectly for:

Desktop

Tablet

Mobile

Chatbot should reposition gracefully (full-width modal style on small screens).

4. Design Requirements

Follow Suviksan’s colors:

Primary Blue: #004C97

Accent Orange: #F58220

Background Gray: #F5F7FA

Use rounded corners (rounded-2xl), smooth shadows (shadow-lg), and gentle transitions.

Fonts: Use Inter or Poppins.

5. Expected Deliverables

Generate a fully working React front-end app containing:

App.jsx – main layout

Navbar.jsx, Hero.jsx, Services.jsx, Chatbot.jsx, Footer.jsx components

tailwind.config.js setup

index.css with base Tailwind styles

Proper routing and folder organization (/components, /assets, /styles)

Functional light/dark mode and chatbot panel toggle
